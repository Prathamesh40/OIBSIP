**Data Analytics Project 1: Wine Quality Prediction – Oasis Infobyte**
**Level 2 Project**
------------------------------------

This project uses 3 machine learning models to predict the quality of red wine based on its chemical properties like acidity, density, and alcohol content.
# Dataset
- **File used:** 'WineQT.csv' 
- **Source:** [Kaggle – Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset)

------------------------------------

# Models Used

1. **Random Forest Classifier** – Accuracy: **82%**  
2. **SGD Classifier** – Accuracy: **69%**  
3. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** – Accuracy: **79%**

> **Best performance:** Random Forest with **~82% accuracy**

------------------------------------

# Summary

- Performed exploratory data analysis and visualized key features  
- Converted wine quality scores into binary labels (Good = 1, Bad = 0)  
- Trained and compared 3 classification models  
- Built a prediction system using the best-performing model (Random Forest)  
- Tested the system by predicting wine quality on sample input data
